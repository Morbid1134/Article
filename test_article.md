**The Dark Side of Programming: A Guide to Ransomware Attacks**

In a shocking revelation, programmers have once again demonstrated their formidable power by penetrating the healthcare system in the UK, shutting down services at two of London's largest hospitals. This cyber attack is just the latest example of how vulnerable our reliance on computer technology has made us.

**The Attack Vector**

While details are still scarce, it appears that the attack was a ransomware attack, where hackers encrypt valuable data and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key. The mainstream media is already pointing fingers at Russia as the culprit, but the true origin of the attack may be irrelevant - after all, a good attacker should be able to operate anonymously from anywhere.

**How Ransomware Attacks Work**

In this video, we'll take a step-by-step look at how ransomware attacks are carried out. The process involves:

1. **Penetration**: Gaining access to a computer system through phishing or installing malicious software.
2. **Exploration**: Locating valuable data and systems that can cripple the business.
3. **Encryption**: Encrypting the data using JavaScript and the node crypto module.
4. **Ransom Note**: Demanding payment in untraceable cryptocurrencies, often written with cut-out letters from magazines to make it completely untraceable.

**The Consequences**

Many ransomware attacks are successful, with victims paying millions of dollars in cryptocurrency to regain access to their data. But what's even more surprising is that some companies may choose to pay the ransom rather than risk losing valuable data or facing reputational damage.

**A Word of Caution**

**Conclusion**

In this video, we've taken a look at the latest ransomware attack in London and provided a step-by-step guide on how these attacks are carried out. While it's important to acknowledge the power of programmers, it's equally important to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and take steps to protect ourselves from these types of threats.
